	<p>
Many times, when rookie photographers get their very first camera and want to experiment, they are told to go outside (unless they already know they’re into stuff that doesn’t move and that can be easily controlled). 
<pre>The truth is that the outdoors holds many pleasant surprises for those in pursuit of a great shot because the wonders of our natural habitat are simply endless. 
And so, if you’re a landscape enthusiast, or in love with the wildlife, or plants, or all of it together, you’re bound to engage in nature photography, one of the medium’s most beautiful, but also most challenging genres. 

While it does involve landscape shots, nature photography mostly refers to all the breathtaking images of animals and plants you keep seeing in the National Geographic magazine or the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition exhibitions. 
</pre>
What’s instantly clear from seeing these nature photography shots is the fact they require a lot of preparation, both physical and mental endurance, patience and attention, which is exactly what makes them so valuable - it is not a coincidence that this type of photography is among the most popular ones with art collectors as well.
